# Responsive Photo Gallery and Lightbox using CSS Grid and vanilla JavaScript

The goal here is to present a responsive Lightbox consisting of an image, a URL link to another site and a description for that image. The Lightbox is opened after the user clicks  an image from the Photo Gallery.

I've used vanilla JavaScript and CSS Grid which will run in major browsers. An example was published at Codepen:
